Open-source C++/CUDA implementation of the Diffeomorphic Log-Demons method for non rigid image registration.


This implementation is based on the previous MATLAB tool that is written by H. Lombaert, publicly available at https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/39194-diffeomorphic-log-demons-image-registration

This tool will need conduct I/O via a custom file format, which is documented in the separate Matlab_IO folder.

The work is linked to the following publication (to appear): 
Performance-aware Programming for Intraoperative Intensity-based Image Registration on Graphics Processing Units
